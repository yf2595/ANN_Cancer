# ANN_Cancer
Training ANN with 3 hidden layers to predict breast cancer using 540 dataSet samples 

First step:
  importing the data set
Second step:
  cleaning the data - replace None , one Hot endcoding/categorial encoding , feature scailing
Third step:
  Spliting to train set and test set
Fourth step:
  creating the ANN , adding hidden layers with different units and activation function for each node.
Five step:
  training the ANN with 100 episodes on the train set.
Sixth step:
  prediction using the test set and computing the accuracy and the results.
